# 🌙 Moon & Meteor Simulation ☄️

A simple **terminal-based simulation** that visualizes the gradual completion of the moon and the circular motion of a meteor around it.  
All parameters are **fully customizable**, allowing the user to experiment with different shapes, sizes, and motions.  

---

## 📝 Description  

- The moon is rendered in **`n_slice`** stages (from crescent to full moon).  
- A meteor moves along a circular orbit while the moon evolves through its phases.  
- Users can freely configure every parameter, such as sizes, positions, and motion steps.  

---

## ⚙️ Parameters  

- **`radius`** → Radius of the moon  
- **`n_slice`** → Number of moon phases (steps to full completion)  
- **`R2`** → Meteor radius  
- **`X0, Y0`** → Initial coordinates of the meteor’s rotation center  
- **`R1`** → Radius of the meteor’s orbital path  
- **`start_n`** → Phase index at which the meteor starts moving  
- **`start_deg`** → Starting angle of the meteor (in **radians**)  
- **`deg_step`** → Step size of the meteor’s rotation (in **radians**)

## ✨ Features  

- 🎛 **Fully configurable** → All parameters can be changed by the user  
- 🖥 **Terminal-based rendering** → Output is displayed directly in the terminal  
- 📚 **Educational purpose** → Great for learning geometry, simulation concepts, and programming practice
